# rentals-demo-backend
Project demonstrating knowledge of Golang using an API to query data on rentals with ability to filter on certain fields

## Project Info
Unfortunately this project isn't at a state where it can fully run. I had never worked with GoLang before doing this but I wanted to take it upon myself to try. 
I watched a few videos and read some articles before creating my app.
I hit a few roadblocks along the way or would get side tracked reading into more about various external libraries and articles related to Go. 
I did as much as I can in slightly longer than the time alotted before calling it quits.
I am confident that if I worked on a developed Go application I would be able to pick up on the lanugage more quickly.
